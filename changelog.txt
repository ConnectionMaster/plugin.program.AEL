[B]Advanced Emulator Launcher | version 0.9.6 | XX December 2016[/B]

WIP      AEL ONLY WORKS ON KRYPTON NOW!!!

WIP      Removed ElementTree dependency in addon.xml. It's not longer needed.

WIP      Use the <news> tag in addon.xml. In general, have a look at http://kodi.wiki/view/addon.xml
         and modernise addon.xml.

WIP      Make use of Krypton feature in the several dialogs of the addon.
         New param: "preselect" for Dialog().multiselect() and Dialog().select(). 
         See http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=250936

WIP      Update code to use xbmcgui.Dialog().select() - additions. Get rid of the ImgSelectDialog()
         class. This need Krypton Beta 4 to run!

WIP      Update launching mechanism. User Python subprocess module on all platforms and not the
         deprecated os.system().

WIP      Log emulator/standalone launcher stdout/stderr into a file. Requires new launching
         mechanism based on subprocess module.

         online and offline scraper.

WIP      Include databases for all supported platforms in AEL offline scraper.

WIP      Add nplayers metadata field to ROMs.

WIP      Support for multidisc systems. Have a look at old AL launcher code.

WIP      Support for several arguments in launcher. This will be useful when using MAME for
         console emulation (MAME consoles from a different region have different names, and an
         European console will typically refuse to run a Japanese game).

WIP      New Arcade Database scraper for MAME ROMs.
