## Installation instructions ##

It is important that you follow this instructions or Advanced Emulator Launcher won't work well.

  1) Go to AML Github main page and click on the green button `Clone or Download` --> `Download ZIP`

  2) Uncompress this ZIP file. This will create a folder named `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher-master`

  3) Rename that folder to `plugin.program.advanced.emulator.launcher`

  4) Compress that folder again into a ZIP file. 

  5) In Kodi, use that ZIP file (and not the original one) to install the plugin in `System` --> `Addons` 
     --> `Install from ZIP file`.

  6) You are done!

# WARNING #

Advanced Emulator Launcher is in a development stage. Please try and test AEL and report on Github if you 
find problems. Play with it, but do not do "serious work" with AEL. "Serious work" means spending lot 
of time configuring metadata. Reason is that AEL is in development, and the format of the plugin 
ROM storage has not been fixed. If I have to change the ROM storage then you will need to 
rescan/reimport your launchers. You have been warned!
