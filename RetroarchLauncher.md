# Creating a Retroarch Launcher

When you create a Retroarch launcher AEL will try to find all Retroarch configuration files available in the application folder.
Either select one of the found configuration files or specify the path to the configuration file manually. Once given AEL will automatically load the configuration file and use the configured cores and infos folder to present the list of available cores.

## Android
The default paths for Retroarch cores and info files under Android are only scannable when the OS is rooted. When running on a non-rooted Android box the best option is to open up Retroarch and configure paths for the cores and infos that are actually accessible. 
Don't forget to update/download the cores and info file after changing the paths.
